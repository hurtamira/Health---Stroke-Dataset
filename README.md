# Health---Stroke-Dataset

In this project, I focused on cleaning the dataset and answered three questions.
I checked the data for duplicates and nulls.
I then rounded up the ages to a full number to provide a clear grouping of ages.
First, is there a correlation between age and stroke(s)?
The correlation coefficient between age and stroke is 0.245298548. 
Second, is there a correlation between BMI and stroke(s)?
The correlation coefficient between BMI and stroke is 0.042373661.
Third, is it more common for a Male or Female to have a stroke(s)?
The count based on this data is Female=2994 and Male=2115.
My findings are that there is a stronger correlation between age and stroke in comparison to BMI and stroke.
It is more common for Females to have a stroke than Males.
